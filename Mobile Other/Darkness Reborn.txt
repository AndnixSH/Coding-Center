1) First you need to have gdb installed on your phone/tablet
https://www.dropbox.com/s/yw23pmqfkr2iazv/gdb 
Or install gdb via Termux app

2) copy this to your /data/temp and give it execute rights via root explorer

3) adb shell to your device

4) As a example were using clash of clans, so start that up

5) In adb shell "ps | grep clash" you should get the pid (process id)

6) run "./gdb --pid 1234" where 1234 is the pid

7) You will get access denied. But this is a muti threaded app so...

8) "ls /proc/1234/task" this will give you the pid's of all the threads

9) Typically i go for the 9th pid down "./gdb --pid 1238" 1238 is the 9th thread down in this example.

10) use the command "gcore" in gdb

11) this will produce a 1238.gcore in your data/temp folder. It take a long time. ABout 20-30 mins. And the file is huge up to 3-4gb.

12) Download this file to your pc. gcore is a memory snapshot of the games memory

13) Next you will need a hex editor. You need to search the gcore for dex.035 the string. This is the header of the dex file.

14) At offset 0x20 you will have the dex size. It stored in little-endian format. There can be up to 20 dex files in the gcore.

15) Cutout the dex and call it classes.dex and open it with ida

16) Should have some info about the app in it if its correct.

17) next remove the odex info from it

This is a sample bad odex commands"
poss remove invoke-direct {p0},

invoke-object-init/range {p0 .. p0},
invoke-direct {p0},
or
invoke-direct {v0}, if it is the start(.this)

invoke-object-init/range {v0 .. v0},
invoke-direct {v0},

invoke-static/range {p0 .. p0},
invoke-static {p0},

"
18) Resave it and pack it back into app. Should run with out encription now ;-)

Whole process take about 30mins - without the gcore time.
