# Mod source codes collections

The collections of my source codes and offsets of the games I have modded, and also others which I got permission to share or which I found from the web. Credit given in the specific files =D
 
You can use them learn and see how I wrote the code, and get ideas. Most codes are very old back to 2014, mostly from dead/abandoned/server closed games. Sources may look messy. I know this repo is obviously a spoonfeeder but... why not share when it's no longer really secret? XD

And also, it's to stop leechers from leeching my offsets when it's impossible to stop them. Now they can just find this straight forward without leeching. I'll try to share my codes of my active mods when i can, but at the same time i don't want devs patching something, maybe i'll do only if idc about specific games

I have turned off issues, because i don't read it often and don't want spam links and noobs asking how to use it.

I WILL ONLY UPLOAD SOURCE WHEN I WANT TO, AND WHEN IT'S SAFE TO DO!

I'll appreciate if you can credit to me and others (if mentioned) at least

Have fun :)
