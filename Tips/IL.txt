What do you mean? I can help if you need help with CIL instructions
it's just 

ldarg.0
callvirt Method name
brtrue
xxxxxx
ret
yyyyyy
ret
for example
PickupManager.Instance.DropPickup(Pickup.E_Type.Xp, Player.Instance.Owner.transform.position, Vector3.up, 1f, false, 25f);
it should be 

callvirt DropPickup
wait
can't i just return 99999?
no
I think this is a void
this is the reason you can't return 99999
so you have to follow the Void instructions
You should open the function 

DropPickup

to see how it works
it's a boolean
it should have a boolean and a float value inside
like this: (void, float, boolean, float): Boolean
if you return simply ldc.i4.1 (true)

then that boolean will apply to ALL circumstances
i see
while they specified the only circumstance in which the boolean should be true
i guess i have to learn C# again
i never worked this in my apk tool
But in most games, as you just said, it will be enough to return ldc.i4.1 because usually, booleans apply to 1 circumstance only
or two
such as the 

get_IsInvincible
this code looks simple Player.Instance.Owner.BlackBoard.Invulnerable = true;
if you returned ldc.i4.1 to get_IsInvincible
your enemy could be invincible, too
this is why you need to specify which circumstance you're using to return true
such as


ldarg.0
call get_IsPlayer
brtrue (ldc.i4.1)
ldc.i4.0
ret
ldc.i4.1
ret
this means: if IsPlayer = IsInvincible, otherwise FALSE
i don't think i will remember all this

Player.Instance.Owner.BlackBoard.Invulnerable = true; is quite simple
if the "BlackBoard" Owner is the Player, then Invulnerable = true
if you just put

Invlunerable = true, then enemies will be invulnerable, too
