Code:

retn = C3 (x86) | BX LR = 70 47 (ARM (Thumb))
mov (x86) | MOV (ARM)
add (x86) | ADD (ARM)
call (x86) | BL (ARM)
EAX EBX ECX EDX, ESI EDI EBP EIP ESP (Registers in x86) | R0 - R15 (Registers in ARM)

FALSE in x86
Code:

mov     eax, 0 = B8 00 00 00 00
retn / ret = C3

FALSE in ARM
Code:

MOVS  R0, #0 = 00 20
BX  LR = 70 47
